                    <h3>Supreme Court Case Semantic Search and Chat Bot</h3>
                    <h5>June - July 2023</h5>
                    <p>I made a chatbot knowledgeable in constitutional law. This was done by creating vector embeddings of the contents of all supreme court rulings and storing them in a Chroma vector database. This allowed a simple chatbot to answer questions with context given by the cases.</p>

                    <h3>MNIST Classification Neural Network without ML Libraries</h3>
                    <h5>December 2022</h5>
                    <p>I developed a multilayer perceptron neural network to classify handwritten digits without using premade machine learning
                    libraries. Instead the I used used the Numpy library for linear algebra. This model had an accuracy of 0.96. The model was trained on the MNIST dataset.</p>

                    <h3>Genre Classification</h3>
                    <h5>November - December 2022</h5>
                    <p>Using a random forest model developed in R, I classified songs into 6 genres using features provided by the Spotify API. The data provided by the Spotify API details subjective musical attributes of the songs with catagories like danceability.</p>

                    <h5>October 2022</h5>
                    <p>I implemented a real-time face blurring software with Gaussian blur, pixelation and blackout methods of obscuration. I
                    used OpenCV for facial detection and masking effects. This project was done as some practice with OpenCV.</p>

                    <h3>Violet Light</h3>
                    <h5>October 2022</h5>
                    <p>For the 24 hour HackViolet Hackathon I developed a mobile app that enables users to check in with their friends while at
                    parties. The app was built in React-Native and the backend was built using Next.js with a Redis database.</p>

                    <h5>November 2021</h5>
                    <p>For the 24 hour HackHolyoke Hackathon I made a web app which tracks the expiration dates of your perishables and reminds
                    you when they are going to go bad. This app won the Best Sustainability Hack. The app was made in React.js and styled
                    using Material UI.</p>

                    <h3>The Buzz</h3>
                    <h5>September - December 2021</h5>
                    <p>I created a full stack social media app including web and mobile front-ends, server backend, and admin cli. The backend
                    was made in Java using the Spark framework and used a PostgreSQL database. Web and mobile front-ends were written in
                    Typescript using React and React-Native respectively with Material UI. This was developed in a 5 person team using
                    Scrum methodology.</p>
